## Usage

At the top of the screen, there is a navigation bar that contains links to an About Me page, a Portfolio page, a Contact Me page, and a Resume Page.

When opening the application for the first time, you will be presented with an About Me page that contains a short bio and a photo of me. Navigating to the Portfolio tab will display a list of previous porjects I have worked on. Each project has a link to the deployed application and a link to the GitHub repository. The Contact Me page contains a form that can be used to send me an email. The Resume page contains a link to my resume and a list of development skills I have learned.
